# 🏙️ Urban Soundscape & Well-being Impact

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates how different urban soundscapes (e.g., traffic, birdsong, construction) affect human well-being. By combining real-world audio recordings with well-being metrics, we aim to derive insights into how cities can be designed to be more sonically and mentally livable.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧠 Analyze correlations between urban sound types and well-being scores.
- 🎵 Identify and classify urban soundscapes using machine learning.
- 🌍 Map sound profiles to geographic zones using spatial metadata.
- 📊 Visualize the impact of soundscapes on public mental health metrics.
